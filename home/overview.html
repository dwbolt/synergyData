The Synergy Project came out the desire for Sustainable Future Center to create synergy amoung it's donors, supporters, volunteers and partner organizations.  The intent is to make the synergy software availalbe to other non-profits as it matures.  Currenlty the software handles Sustainable Future Centers:
