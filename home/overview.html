The Synergy Project came out of the desire for Sustainable Future Center to create synergy among it's donors,
 supporters, volunteers, and partner organizations.  The intent is to make the synergy software available to 
 other non-profits as it matures.  Sustainable Future Center is currently using the software for it's website and accounting. 
 We are starting the planning process for the CRM now.
